<h1 align="center">Bouncy Pacmen</h1>

<p align="center">
This is the Pacman project I learned how to build in Week 4 of my MIT masters certificate and then expanded on in week 7. This program should create a user defined amount of Pacmen that bounce from wall to wall. The walls are the size of the viewing window! Click "Add One Pacman" to do just that. Then, you can click "Send Pacmen Off" to send them off and again to speed up the pace. Non of the pacmen bump into one another.
